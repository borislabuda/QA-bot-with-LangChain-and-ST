This is a test document for the QA RAG chatbot.

The document contains information about artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

The key benefits of AI include:
- Automation of repetitive tasks
- Enhanced decision making
- Improved efficiency
- Better customer experiences

Common applications of AI include:
- Natural language processing
- Computer vision
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis

This test document can be used to verify that the QA system can answer questions about AI and machine learning concepts.
